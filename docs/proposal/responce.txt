Approach: Its not clear what you mean by base network, are you planning on designing your own network or use Udacity networks? And what sort of modification are you planning to bring about to the network? Also using different networks connected to a voter falls into n-version programming and not TMR. Assuming that you're focusing on input faults, TMR wouldn't make sense here. Are you considering adversarial inputs or also natural perturbations?
Backup Plan: There are no contingency plans mentioned, you need to have backup options for the whole project idea or different parts of the approach. Please revise these in the progress report.
