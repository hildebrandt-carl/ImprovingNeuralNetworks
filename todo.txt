We could analyze the adversarial dataset generation to see which attacks are better on which networks. This could be interesting as like a "Case study" on what attack types are important vs what attack types are not.

I need to run everything on Big machine

We could also generate a measure of how easily adversarail images are generated for the network. Ie run the adversarial tool on the both the final networks.

Analysis of the training data

Add dotted lines around the workflow image indicating what is what.

Removed SLSQPAttack due to it being TRASH
